# Overview
mem_chk_perm is a simple utility that tests memory access permissions from a 
userspace application's perspective. It helps analyze writable regions in 
memory, particularly around the stack boundary.

# Usage
```
mem_chk_perm <mode>
```
* <mode>: A number (1-7) interpreted as a bitmap indicating where to 
  attempt writes in the tested memory area:
    * Bit 0: Beginning of the memory area
    * Bit 1: Center of the memory area
    * Bit 2: End of the memory area

# Observations
While testing, an unexpected behavior was observed when using mode 4.
Memory just before the stack boundary appeared writable, despite being 
unmapped according to /proc/self/maps. 
This behavior is attributed to Linuxâ€™s stack expansion mechanism. 
The kernel pre-allocates an expansion zone for the stack, allowing 
writes to this reserved area before officially expanding it.

# Notes
* The Linux kernel initially reserves 128KB for stack growth.

* Writing to the memory zone before the stack may not always trigger 
  a segmentation fault due to this pre-allocation.
